Draft Genie is an intuitive machine learning model used to predict when college players will potentially be drafted
during the nba draft. It uses many python packages such as Pandas, Numpy, and scikit-learn to read in data and produce
a model. It uses draft data from 1990 to present day to create the model and maximize accuracy. This was written by 
the brilliant minds of Sam Rosenberg and Justin Kramer. Justin primarily focused on the front end and produced the
beautifully looking website you see right now. He used HTML, CSS and Javscript to create the website. Sam worked primarily
on the backend and developed the machine learning algorithm used to predict when players will be drafted. He used mainly 
python and its various packages to create a model and then extensively tested using other data.
